refactor(auth): Adopt shared DTOs and refine auth hooks

Align authentication hooks (useLogin, useRegister, useAuth) with shared DTOs from `@vivero/shared` to enhance type safety and consistency across the application.

- Replaced local `LoginRequest`, `LoginResponse`, `RegisterRequest`, and `RegisterResponse` interfaces with `LoginAuthDto`, `RegisterAuthDto`, and `AuthResponseDto`.
- Updated `useMutation` and `signIn` function signatures to use the new shared DTOs.
- Removed the deprecated `login` helper function from `client-fetch.ts`.
- Refactored authentication page loading indicators to use `AuthSkeleton` for improved UX consistency.

This change centralizes type definitions for authentication flows, reducing redundancy and potential for discrepancies between frontend and backend contracts.
