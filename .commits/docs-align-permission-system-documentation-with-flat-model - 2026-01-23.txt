docs: Align permission system documentation with flat model

Updated various agent documentation files to reflect the project's adoption
of a simple, flat permission model, moving away from a traditional
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) approach.

Key changes include:
- Clarified the interpretation of "roles" as predefined permission sets.
- Replaced explicit "Role-based access control" references with
  "Permission-based access control" or "Permission management system" across
  `tech_stack_guide.md`, `agricultural-backend-agent.md`,
  `product-manager-agent.md`, `qa_agent.md`, and `solo_developer_roadmap.md`.
- Updated `enterprise-pure-role.md` with a note explaining this interpretation.

This ensures all documentation is consistent with the chosen granular
permission system.
