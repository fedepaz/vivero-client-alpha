feat(auth): enhance token configuration and add conditional debug logging

This commit improves the auth module for more granular control
and a better debugging experience.

- Separates JWT expiration into `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` and
  `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN`, allowing independent control over token lifespans.

- Adds detailed, development-only debug logging to the `generateTokens` function.
  This logging is wrapped in a `NODE_ENV === 'development'` check to prevent
  exposing secrets in production.

- Improves user feedback by providing more specific error messages for invalid
  emails versus invalid passwords on login.
