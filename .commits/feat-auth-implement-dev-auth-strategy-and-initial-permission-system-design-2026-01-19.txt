feat(auth): implement dev auth strategy and initial permission system design

This commit introduces a new development authentication strategy that
uses a local database user instead of hardcoded values. It also
removes all Clerk-related code and configuration.

Key changes:
- Implemented a `DevAuthStrategy` that fetches user data from the
  database.
- Added a `seed.ts` script to populate the database with a default
  tenant, roles, and an admin user.
- Removed Clerk configuration from `.env.example` and
  `configuration.ts`.
- Added new documentation outlining a hybrid RBAC + ABAC permission
  system design.
- Updated `.env.example` with new environment variables for local
  development.
- Added untracked documentation files for enterprise RBAC design.
