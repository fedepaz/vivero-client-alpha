feat(auth): implement automatic JWT refresh token logic on frontend

This commit implements a robust, automatic JWT refresh token mechanism
in the `clientFetch` utility. This ensures a seamless user experience
by preventing abrupt logouts when an access token expires.

Key implementations include:
- An interceptor that catches 401 Unauthorized errors.
- A `refreshAccessToken` function to get a new token from the `/auth/refresh` endpoint.
- A request queue to gracefully handle concurrent API calls during a refresh.
- Automatic retry of failed requests upon successful token refresh.
- A central `logout` function to clear session data if the refresh fails.
- Helper functions for `login` and `logoutUser` to streamline auth actions.
