feat: update next.js and refactor frontend configuration

This commit updates Next.js to version 16 and refactors the ESLint
and TypeScript configurations in the frontend application to align
with modern standards.

Key changes include:
- Upgraded Next.js from v15 to v16.
- Migrated ESLint configuration to the new flat config format.
- Updated tsconfig.json for better compatibility.
- Added pnpm overrides for `hono` and `lodash` to resolve security
  vulnerabilities.
- Minor UI tweaks and code refinements for improved responsiveness
  and cleanup.
