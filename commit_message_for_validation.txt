feat(auth): implement full jwt refresh flow and auth hooks

This commit introduces a comprehensive overhaul of the frontend
authentication system, implementing a robust JWT refresh token
mechanism and significantly refactoring auth-related hooks and components.

Key changes include:

- **Automatic Token Refresh**: The `client-fetch` utility now
  automatically detects 401 Unauthorized errors, queues failed
  requests, and uses the refresh token to obtain a new access
  token before retrying the original request.
- **Improved Error Handling**: A custom `ApiError` class has been
  introduced to provide more detailed error information, including
  HTTP status codes. The `useAuthUserProfile` hook now automatically
  logs the user out on 401/403 errors, preventing invalid states.
- **Refactored Auth Hooks & Components**: The login and register forms
  have been refactored into self-contained components that use
  `useMutation`'s `async` methods, correcting the original redirect bug.
- **Centralized Providers**: Application-wide providers (like
  QueryClient and Theme) have been consolidated into a single
  `AppProviders` component for cleaner architecture.
- **Enhanced Protected Routes**: The `DashboardProtectedLayout` now
  handles redirects for unauthenticated users, providing a more
  reliable route protection mechanism.
