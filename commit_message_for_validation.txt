feat(auth): implement full JWT refresh flow and auth hooks

This commit introduces a complete, robust authentication flow on the frontend.
It includes automatic token refreshes and a suite of custom hooks
for easy consumption by UI components.

Key implementations include:
- A full JWT refresh mechanism in `client-fetch.ts` to handle 401s and retry requests.
- A request queue to gracefully manage concurrent API calls during a refresh.
- New hooks (`useLogin`, `useLogout`, `useRegister`) for clean, reusable auth actions.
- Standardized localStorage keys for tokens and user profiles across the app.
