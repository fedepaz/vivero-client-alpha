refactor(frontend): overhaul auth state management and unify providers

Introduces a major refactoring of the frontend authentication
architecture to resolve state management and redirection issues.

- **Unified Auth Provider:**
  - Replaces `AuthUserProfileProvider` with a new, unified `AuthProvider`.
  - This provider combines auth state (`isSignedIn`) and user profile
    state into a single global context (`useAuthContext`).
  - All components and hooks now consume this unified context,
    ensuring consistent state across the app.

- **Centralized Redirection:**
  - Enhances `useAuth` to use browser events for reliable state syncing.
  - `dashboard-protected-layout.tsx` now uses the global context to
    protect routes.
  - Removes manual `router.push()` calls from login and logout flows.

- **UI & Component Updates:**
  - Replaces hardcoded colors in layout components with theme variables.
  - Layouts now display dynamic user info (name, username, initials).
  - Updates `register-form` to use `username` and removes `roleId`.

- **Backend Seeding:**
  - Deletes the `prisma/seed.ts` file as part of an evolving strategy.
