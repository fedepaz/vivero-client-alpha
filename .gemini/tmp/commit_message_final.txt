feat(auth): transition to username-based auth and refactor users module

This commit shifts the authentication system from email to username-based.
It aligns with the project's defined authentication strategy.

Auth Module Changes:
- Adds a public `/auth/register` endpoint.
- Updates the `/auth/login` endpoint to use `username`.
- Auth repositories and services now use `username` for user lookups.
- Shared DTOs and types in `@vivero/shared` are updated with `username`.

Users Module Refactoring:
- Adds new endpoints to the `UsersController` for finding users by
  username (`/users/username/:username`) and tenant (`/users/tenant/:tenantId`).
- The `UsersRepository` is updated with `findByUsername` and `findByTenantId`.
- New endpoints are protected by the global `GlobalAuthGuard`.

Database Seeding (`seed.ts`):
- The seed script is refactored to populate the DB with multiple test users.
- Removes the previous logic for creating `admin` and `user` roles.
