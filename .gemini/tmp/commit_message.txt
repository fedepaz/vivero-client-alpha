feat(auth): switch to username-based authentication

This commit modifies the authentication system to use usernames instead of emails for login and registration.

Key changes:
- Added a `register` endpoint to the `AuthController`.
- Auth-related repositories and services now query for users by `username`.
- The `AuthUser` type and shared DTOs (`LoginAuthDto`, `RegisterAuthDto`, `AuthResponseDto`) have been updated to include the `username` field.
- The database seed script (`seed.ts`) has been updated to generate multiple users with usernames.
- Secured the `users` endpoint with `JwtAuthGuard`.
